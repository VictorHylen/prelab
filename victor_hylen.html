    <h1>Hello world</h1>

    <p>
        I have no expreince in Web development. I have always have a some basic knowledge about backend and frontend, but never any deaper knowledge. 
        Frontend compared to Backend seems to be more straight forward and easier to understand and seems to be really fun to design your own webbsites. As a student i computer science, My main 
        interest when pogramming is for most part "How does this work" and maybe not "How does this look", The reason for that is when pograming the main goal is just to get it userfriendly and focus on the "system"
